# DRL-CollaborationAndCompetition
Udacity project #3
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to train agents that control tennis rackets.  We want the agents to be able to hit a ball back and forth over a net.  The goal is collaborative in that both agents are trying to keep the "rally" going by keeping the ball in play (rather than trying to beat each other).
